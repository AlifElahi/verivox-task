# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Title: Component-Based Architecture with CDK Virtual Scrolling and Reusability

### Context
This project aims to render item cards within a responsive, mobile-first list layout, optimizing DOM handling for performance and providing a scalable foundation for future feature expansion. The architecture must support:
1. **Reusability**: Components and UI elements should be modular and easy to reuse across the application.
2. **Performance Optimization**: The application needs to handle large datasets efficiently.
3. **Maintainability**: Code structure should support future growth and be easy to test and update.
4. **Styling Consistency**: Use of CSS preprocessing to maintain styling consistency across the application.

### Decision
To meet the project goals, the following architectural choices were made:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: 
   - Components are modular and designed to be reused, with most UI elements placed in a shared UI folder. This approach promotes reusability and keeps the codebase DRY.
   - Each component encapsulates its logic, reducing dependencies and making individual components easy to test and maintain.

2. **CDK Virtual Scrolling for List Rendering**:
   - Angularâ€™s CDK Virtual Scrolling is implemented to efficiently render only visible items in the DOM, reducing memory usage and improving performance. While an alternative approach could involve using a simple `<div>` container and `ngFor` to render items, this would risk significant lag and high memory usage when dealing with large datasets, negatively impacting user experience.

3. **Dynamic Component Rendering Using Directives**:
   - Custom directives allow for dynamic component rendering by passing a component reference for each item in the list. This enhances the flexibility of list items and encourages reusability for future features.

4. **Lazy Loading of Modules**:
   - Feature-specific modules are loaded on demand, reducing the initial load time and improving overall application performance by only loading what is necessary.

5. **CSS Preprocessing with Mixins and Variables**:
   - A CSS preprocessing system is used to ensure styling consistency across components. Variables are defined for commonly used values (e.g., colors, font sizes), and mixins are employed for repeated styling patterns. This approach simplifies styling updates, enforces DRY principles, and maintains a cohesive visual identity.

6. **Unit Testing for Key Components**:
   - Unit tests are created for most components, focusing on components with complex functionality or where testing is essential for maintaining stability. This supports a maintainable codebase and helps catch issues early in development.

### Consequences
- **Enhanced Reusability and Maintainability**: The component-based structure and use of directives for dynamic rendering create a highly modular system that is easy to extend.
- **Improved Performance**: The use of CDK Virtual Scrolling and lazy loading optimizes the application for large datasets and minimizes unnecessary resource usage.
- **Consistent and Scalable Styling**: CSS preprocessing with mixins and variables ensures consistent styling across the application and allows for scalable design updates.
- **Testable Codebase**: Unit tests for key components provide a foundation for future development and reduce the risk of regression issues.

### Notes
This ADR documents the primary architectural decisions for the project.
